# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
The Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis project is a comprehensive end-to-end data analytics study that explores retail customer transaction data to uncover actionable business insights. The project uses Python for data cleaning and preprocessing, SQL for structured analysis and querying, and Power BI for interactive visualization and dashboarding.

Project Overview 🌟

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover actionable business insights. Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, it addresses key questions for retail analytics:

Who contributes most to revenue?
How does subscription affect repeat purchases?
Which customer segments and products are most profitable?

It demonstrates a full analytics workflow:
Data Cleaning → SQL Analysis → Dashboard Visualization → Business Insights.
